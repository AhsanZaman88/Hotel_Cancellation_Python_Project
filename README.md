#Hotel Reservation Cancellation Analysis
Introduction
The Hotel Reservation Cancellation Analysis project is a Python-based data analysis initiative aimed at understanding and analyzing high cancellation rates in hotel reservations.There are two types of hotels "Resort Hotel" and "City Hotel". By examining historical reservation data, this project identifies patterns and key factors that contribute to cancellations, enabling hotel management to make informed decisions to reduce cancellation rates and optimize occupancy.

Features:
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Processes raw data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes and explores data to uncover trends and patterns related to cancellations.
Statistical Analysis: Identifies significant factors influencing reservation cancellations.
Reporting: Summarizes findings with clear visualizations and actionable insights.

Future Work:
Predictive Modeling: Develop models to forecast cancellations.
Feature Engineering: Enhance features to capture more patterns.
Dashboard Creation: Build visual dashboards for real-time monitoring of cancellation trends.
